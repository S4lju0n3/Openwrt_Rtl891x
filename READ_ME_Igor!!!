1. You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
   find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

2. When you build the SDK for the first time,some internet download operations will be needed,hence the internet service must be avalible on your build code
  environment.

   --> execute "make menuconfig" , just leave&save it if no configurations need to be changed.

   --> execute "make" (build image) or "make V=99" (build image with compiling log)

NOTE1 : Sometimes the make process will be stopped due to the in-consistent kerenl config option,
you can do "make kernel_menuconfig" to select some new kernel options or just save&exit to sync 
the kernel options to consistent.
